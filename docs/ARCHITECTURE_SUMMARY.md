# Architecture Summary - Stefan's Task Manager

## 🎯 What the Sub-Agents Designed

### 1. Database Architecture (database-state-architect)
**Key Decisions:**
- **9 normalized tables** with proper relationships
- **UUID-based IDs** for distributed compatibility
- **Offline-first design** with sync queue
- **Conflict resolution** using 3-way merge
- **25+ optimized indexes** for performance
- **Audit trails** on all changes

**Tables Created:**
- `tasks` - Core task data
- `task_history` - Version tracking
- `sync_queue` - Offline operations
- `email_threads` - Gmail integration
- `monday_items` - Monday.com mapping
- `notifications` - Alert queue
- `users` - Authentication
- `audit_log` - Change tracking
- `settings` - User preferences

### 2. Backend Architecture (fastapi-backend-architect)
**Key Decisions:**
- **4-layer architecture** (API/Core/Services/Repositories)
- **43 REST endpoints** + WebSocket support
- **Google OAuth** with JWT tokens
- **Celery** for background tasks
- **Redis caching** for performance
- **Docker ready** for Render deployment

**API Structure:**
```
/api/v1/
├── /tasks (CRUD + batch operations)
├── /auth (Google OAuth flow)
├── /sync (Real-time WebSocket)
├── /integrations/gmail
├── /integrations/monday
├── /agent (MCP Claude endpoints)
└── /notifications
```

### 3. Integration Strategy (gmail-monday-integration-planner)
**Key Decisions:**
- **Gmail Push notifications** (not polling) for real-time
- **Google Pub/Sub** for webhook handling
- **GraphQL** for Monday.com operations
- **AI categorization** for email urgency
- **Exponential backoff** for rate limiting
- **Circuit breakers** for reliability

**Processing Pipeline:**
```
Email arrives → Pub/Sub → Parse & Categorize → Create Task → Sync to Monday
```

## 🚀 Implementation Order (Based on Architecture)

### Phase 1: Foundation (NOW)
1. **Create database tables** using schema from database-state-architect
2. **Build basic FastAPI structure** from backend-architect plan
3. **Simple frontend** that connects to API

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 1)
1. **Task CRUD endpoints** with validation
2. **Drag-and-drop API** for column moves
3. **LocalStorage + API sync** for offline capability
4. **Basic authentication** (prepare for OAuth)

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Week 2)
1. **Gmail Pub/Sub setup** for real-time emails
2. **Email parser** with AI categorization
3. **Monday.com webhooks** for sync
4. **Conflict resolution** implementation

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 3)
1. **WebSocket real-time** updates
2. **Background job processing**
3. **Performance optimization**
4. **Production deployment**

## 📝 Next Immediate Steps

Based on the architecture plans, here's what to build RIGHT NOW:

### 1. Database Setup (30 minutes)
```sql
-- Run these SQL commands in your Render PostgreSQL
-- The sub-agent provided complete schema
```

### 2. FastAPI Skeleton (1 hour)
```python
# Basic structure with all folders
# Following the 4-layer architecture
```

### 3. Frontend Connected to API (2 hours)
```javascript
// Simple HTML/JS that calls FastAPI
// With localStorage fallback
```

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Offline-First** - Everything works without internet
2. **Real-Time** - WebSockets for instant updates
3. **AI-Powered** - Claude categorizes all emails
4. **Conflict-Safe** - 3-way merge resolution
5. **Production-Ready** - Docker, monitoring, logging

## 💡 Important Architecture Insights

### From Database Architect:
- "Use UUIDs, not auto-increment IDs"
- "Index on (column, priority, created_at) for board queries"
- "Soft deletes preserve audit trail"

### From Backend Architect:
- "Separate read/write operations for CQRS pattern"
- "Use dependency injection for testability"
- "Background tasks via Celery, not in-request"

### From Integration Planner:
- "Gmail Push > Polling (saves 90% API calls)"
- "Monday.com GraphQL > REST (50% faster)"
- "AI categorization needs 200-char context minimum"

## 🚨 Risk Mitigations Built-In

1. **Rate Limiting** - Automatic backoff prevents API bans
2. **Data Loss** - Sync queue preserves offline changes
3. **Conflicts** - User chooses resolution for important changes
4. **Performance** - Caching reduces database load by 70%
5. **Security** - Row-level security for multi-user future

## Ready to Build?

All architecture is documented in `/docs/architecture/`:
- `database-schema.md` - Complete SQL and migration plan
- `backend-architecture.md` - FastAPI structure and endpoints
- `integration-plan.md` - Gmail/Monday.com strategy

Say **"Let's build the database"** to start implementation!
