# ðŸš€ START HERE - Stefan's Quick Action Guide

## What We're Building
A smart Kanban board that automatically turns your emails into tasks, syncs with Monday.com, and sends you SMS alerts - all powered by AI that understands your concrete business.

## RIGHT NOW - Do These First (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Create These Free Accounts (15 min)
Go create accounts and save the credentials:

1. **Google Cloud Console** - https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Create new project called "Stefan-Tasks"
   - Enable Gmail API
   - We'll set up OAuth after we have a backend

2. **Monday.com Developer** - https://developer.monday.com
   - Use your existing Monday account
   - Go to "My Apps" â†’ Create app
   - Save the API token somewhere safe

3. **Twilio** - https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
   - Sign up for free trial
   - You'll get $15 credit (enough for ~1000 SMS)
   - Get a phone number
   - Save your Account SID and Auth Token

4. **Render** - âœ… YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS!
   - Just make sure it's linked to your GitHub
   - We'll use this for backend + database

### Step 2: Save Your Credentials (5 min)
Create a file called `secrets.txt` (NOT in the project folder) with:
```
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=
MONDAY_API_TOKEN=
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
STEFAN_PHONE=
CLAUDE_API_KEY=(you already have this)
```

### Step 3: Tell Me When Ready (10 min)
Once you have all accounts set up, tell me:
"I have all the accounts ready, let's build the frontend"
